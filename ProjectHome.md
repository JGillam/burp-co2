## Latest Burp CO<sub>2</sub> Suite binary:  [Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_0PMu9iUbMOWFhKY3pFdWxaVVE/view?usp=sharing) ##

CO<sub>2</sub> is a project for lightweight and useful enhancements to Portswigger's popular Burp Suite web penetration tool through the standard Extender API.  If you are looking for the binaries, you can find them in the BApp Store within Burp.  The latest standalone .jar versions are also available [here](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B_0PMu9iUbMOWmdZQ3A0LWRNb28&usp=sharing#list).

CO<sub>2</sub> is comprised of both a suite of modules as well as standalone versions of some of these modules, either due to popular request or while still in early development prior to being added to the suite.  The objectives of all CO<sub>2</sub> modules include:

  * Free and open source
  * Works on both Free and Pro versions of Burp (except where Free version limits functionality, e.g. Intruder rate limits)
  * Lightweight with respect to memory and CPU utilization
  * Avoid third party library dependencies
  * Help available (online help, examples, etc...)


See the [Co2Modules](Co2Modules.md) wiki page for descriptions of each of the modules in CO<sub>2</sub>.

See [ReleaseNotes](ReleaseNotes.md) for updates.

If you are interested in contributing or playing with the code, check out [IntelliJSetup](IntelliJSetup.md) for instructions on setting this up in IntelliJ IDEA.

Please make sure you are running the latest release version of Burp Suite before installing this extension.  Changes to the Burp APIs may break backward compatibility with earlier versions of Burp.
